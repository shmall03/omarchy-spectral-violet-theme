# Omarchy Spectral Violet Theme 🌌

A deep, ethereal violet theme for the Omarchy ecosystem. Inspired by post-spectralist aesthetics and the natural harmonic series, this theme balances dark, obsidian backgrounds with vibrant, lavender-to-purple accents.

Designed with high-contrast typography and a flowy aesthetic, **Spectral Violet** is built for focus, clarity, and a touch of mathematical precision.

## 🎹 Inspiration
The name **Spectral Violet** refers to the post-spectralist movement in music — focusing on the properties of sound itself and the harmonic series. Much like a complex chord being broken down into its constituent frequencies, this theme breaks down the violet spectrum into a functional, cohesive workspace.
